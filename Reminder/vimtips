No +clipboard?

Vim requires the +clipboard feature flag for any of this to work; you can check if your Vim has this by using :echo has('clipboard') from within Vim (if the output is 0, it not present, if it's 1, it is), or checking the output of vim --version.

Most Linux distributions ship with a "minimal" Vim build by default, which doesn't have +clipboard, but you can usually install it:

    Debian & Ubuntu: Install vim-gtk or vim-gnome.
    Fedora: install vim-X11, and run vimx instead of vim (more info).
    Arch Linux: install gvim (this will enable +clipboard for normal vim as well).

You could also use xclip, xcopy, or xsel to copy text to the clipboard; see Define custom commands for the * and + registers for more information on that.

Copy/Paste workflow tips :)

In Arch linux + this config case -> 
- use gvim package (It include clipboard support)
- use xclip package. 

For vim to x clipboard (Copy text from vim to x clipboard)
- use visual mode + : + cz to copy text to x clipboard. (It's look like this -> :'<,'>cz)
- fcitx -> ^C+; to paste in app that support multiple line (which something that st is not)

For x clipboard to vim (Paste to vim)
- In normal mode -> press "+p or "*p to paste
